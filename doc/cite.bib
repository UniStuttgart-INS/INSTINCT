  abstract     = {Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) remote sensing of the troposphere, called GNSS meteorology, is already a wellestablished tool in post-processing applications. Real-time GNSS meteorology has been possible since 2013, when the International GNSS Service (IGS) established its real-time service. The reported accuracy of the real-time zenith total delay (ZTD) has not improved significantly over time and usually remains at the level of 5–18 mm, depending on the station and test period studied. Millimeter-level improvements are noticed due to GPS ambiguity resolution, gradient estimation, or multi-GNSS processing. However, neither are these achievements combined in a single processing strategy, nor is the impact of other processing parameters on ZTD accuracy analyzed. Therefore, we discuss these shortcomings in detail and present a comprehensive analysis of the sensitivity of real-time ZTD on processing parameters. First, we identify a so-called common strategy, which combines processing parameters that are identified to be the most popular among published papers on the topic. We question the popular elevation-dependent weighting function and introduce an alternative one. We investigate the impact of selected processing parameters, i.e., PPP functional model, GNSS selection and combination, inter-system weighting, elevation-dependent weighting function, and gradient estimation. We define an advanced strategy dedicated to real-time GNSS meteorology, which is superior to the common one. The a posteriori error of estimated ZTD is reduced by 41\%. The accuracy of ZTD estimates with the proposed strategy is improved by 17\% with respect to the IGS final products and varies over stations from 5.4 to 10.1 mm. Finally, we confirm the latitude dependency of ZTD accuracy, but also detect its seasonality.},

  abstract     = {This research presents the analysis of using different weighting functions for the GPS and Galileo observations in Precise Point Positioning (PPP) performance for globally located stations for one week in 2021. Eight different weighting functions of observations dependent on the elevation angle have been selected. It was shown that the use of different weighting functions has no impact on the horizontal component but has a visible impact on the vertical component, the tropospheric delay and the convergence time. Depending on the solutions, i.e., GPS-only, Galileo-only or GPS+Galileo, various weighting functions turned out to the best. The obtained results confirm that the Galileo solution has comparable accuracy to the GPS solution. Also, with the Galileo solution, the best results were obtained for functions with a smaller dependence on the elevation angle than for GPS, since Galileo observations at lower elevation angles have better performance than GPS observations. Finally, a new weighting approach was proposed, using two different weighting functions from the best GPS-only and Galileo-only for GPS+Galileo solution. This approach improves the results by 5\% for convergence time and 30\% for the troposphere delay when compared to using the same function.},

  abstract     = {Different designs of receiver correlators and front ends will cause different biases in terms of the pseudorange. In this paper, we present an algorithm to derive GNSS receiver-dependent code biases by estimating an additional code bias for each satellite based on different orbit and clock products and apply the calibrated biases in user positioning. One-month data from 117 globally distributed multi-GNSS experiment stations are selected to analyze the characteristics of BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) code biases, including BDS-2 and BDS-3 satellites. It is shown that the BDS code biases on B1I and B3I signals differ by receiver type, receiver model, antenna type, or even unknown factors. The code biases on BDS-2 satellites can reach up to 4 ns from peak to peak, while they are within 2 ns for BDS-3 satellites. The receiver-dependent code biases are calibrated based on the broadcast ephemeris and the precise products. With a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.9, it is demonstrated that the calibrated code biases are in agreement not only among different products, but also with previous result of BDS-2. To validate the effect of the calibrated code biases, we apply them in single point positioning (SPP), precise point positioning (PPP), and real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning. It is proven that with corrected BDS code biases, SPP users will benefit from an overall improvement of 9.5\%, 9.9\%, and 27.4\% at B1I, B3I, and B1I/ B3I ionosphere-free frequencies. For the ionosphere-free based positioning using BDS-3 only, the impact of code biases cannot be ignored. The corrected code biases will accelerate the convergence performance in PPP. For RTK applications, especially for single-frequency users, the fixing rate and ratio values will also improve when the code biases are corrected.},

A modified LAMBDA (MLAMBDA) method is presented. Several strategies are proposed to reduce the computational complexity of the LAMBDA method. Numerical simulations show that MLAMBDA is (much) faster than LAMBDA.

  abstract   = {"Knowledge of your current location is now taken for granted by people worldwide. This state of affairs is largely due to the advent of satellite-based navigation systems, particularly the Global Positioning System (GPS). These Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are still rapidly evolving with more capability and even greater robustness. The fundamental purpose of all of them is determining location in four dimensions--3 of geographical positions plus time. A user is indifferent to the source of location knowledge--any technique will do if it is reliable. While much of this book is devoted to satellite-based navigation systems, or SatNavs, we intend to give full explanations of virtually all modern sources of position, navigation, and time (PNT)"--},

  abstract   = {Satellite-based formation flying Earth observations are crucial for environmental monitoring and sustainable use of our Earth’s resources. One example is the German mission TanDEM-X, for which the twin satellites TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X are working together to derive highly precise digital elevation models. To interpret the measurement data of such satellites correctly, the post-processing algorithms depend on precise millimeter-level knowledge of their relative position, known as their baseline. One technique for deriving estimates of the required precision is Precise Baseline Determination (PBD) based on measurements from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). While the latest available advancements in PBD are suitable for meeting the current precision requirements of non-agile missions, future Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) projects will require the same precision for agile mission profiles. Additionally, the PBD for agile missions is dependent on precise knowledge of the satellite’s attitude. Usually, the PBD and the attitude estimation are performed independently from each other. Whereas PBD utilizes GNSS observations with one receiver per spacecraft, the attitude is estimated via star trackers and inertial measurement units.},
